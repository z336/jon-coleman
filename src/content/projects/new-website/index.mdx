You're looking at it!

For this site, I wanted to create something that is fast and accessible, but also reflects my personality and tastes. If I can't be myself here then I wouldn't know what else to do.

## Goals

- Fast and accessible
- Aesthetically "me"
- Clean, semantic markup
- Minimal CSS with maximum effect

## Technologies, skills, & ideas

Building this site involved everything I have learned about frontend web development and design. The following skills, frameworks, ideas, etc. were employed in its creation:

- <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Gatsby
  </a>
  , a popular static site generator built on React.
- CSS-in-JS solutions that embrace the cascade. Many of the ideas for how to approach problems, and some of the layouts, were inspired by Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell's <a href="https://every-layout.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Every Layout</a>.
- Markdown for source content and GraphQL for querying the data.
- Punk records.
