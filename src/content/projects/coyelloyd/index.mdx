## Goals

For Coye's marketing site, I focused on these areas of interest:

### Style

The client for this site is a lover of film, culture, art, and magazines. We agreed that we didn't want the site to be heavy with film styling, as she may potentially write about a number of subjects. So we chose a modern magazine layout that resembles what you might see in a high end fashion or photography magazine. Simple, bold, and effective.

### Maintainability

I will not be updating the blog posts for this site going forward, so maintainability by the client was key for the project. I chose to set up the site with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify CMS</a> so that the user could create new blog posts on their own with a basic CMS editor and update the site.

### Performance & Accessibility

Anyone should be able to read and enjoy Coye's content, regardless of ability. Special care was taken to make sure her site is as accessible as possible and performs as well as my own portfolio site.
