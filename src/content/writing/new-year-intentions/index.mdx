I've had some time off and a therefore a chance to consider what's in store for the year ahead. In no particular order, here are some intentions:

- Keep exercising.
- Continue to work on my writing, both for fun and for technical documentation.
- Create more things. Code, D&D campaigns, mixtapes, whatever! I'm always happier when I'm creating and I start to crumble a bit when I am not.
- Have some fun, despite all the things.
